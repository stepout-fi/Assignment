# StepOut Front-End Intern Assignment

You will have 14 days to complete your assignment. Please notify us when you are done with the tasks. Send an email to us when you are done or if you have any questions. Happy coding and good luck!

## Installation and Setup

[Adobe XD](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/xd?mv=affiliate&mv2=red) is a free design tool where you must use to get the exact design value on the web application design implementation.

All UI resouces could and should be refered to by using the [UI source file](./intern-test-UI.xd). Please remember that you **do not** have to purchase the full version of Adobe XD in  order to open our [UI source file](./intern-test-UI.xd). Refer to [XD Starter Plan](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/kb/changes-to-xd-starter-plan.html) to learn more.
